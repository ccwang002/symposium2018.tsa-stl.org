                <p>The pathogenesis of complex immunologic diseases (including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], among others) involve environmental triggers on genetically susceptible hosts. Genome-wide association studies have identified a wide spectrum of susceptibility genes for these diseases. For instance, over 170 susceptibility genes are associated with the development of IBD, including identification of ethnic-specific gene lists. Likewise, several potential environmental triggers have been shown to be associated with IBD development and/or prognosis (e.g., microbiome). The collection of the various genetic, transcriptomic, and microbiota big data sets provide us clues of how these factors can potentially interconnect. These big data pools also facilitate the development of next generation, rationally-designed translational research strategies for IBD and other complex immunologic diseases that can identify disease-relevant pathways and therapeutic targets.</p>

                <h3>Tumor Microenvironment Sugar Fighting: Metabolic Competition Can Determine Cancer Progression</h3>
                <p>
                  <em>Chih-Hao “Lucas” Chang, Ph.D.</em><br>
                  Instructor in Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis

                </p>
                <p>Properly functioning T cells are critical for effective tumor immunity. Upon activation, T cells engage aerobic glycolysis and this metabolic adaptation is required for the optimal production of effector cytokines that mediate tumor clearance. However, during cancer T cells often experience a progressive decline in effector functions, preventing tumor regression. Failure of T cells to protect against cancer is thought to result from lack of antigen recognition, chronic activation, and/or suppression by other cells. Using a mouse sarcoma model, we showed that glucose consumption by tumors metabolically restricts T cells in the tumor microenvironment, which dampens their mTOR activity and glycolytic capacity, limits their IFN-γ production, and leads to tumor progression. We demonstrated that enhancing glycolysis in an antigenic ‘regressor’ tumor is sufficient to override the ability of T cells to respond to a major tumor rejection antigen, allowing progression of tumors that are normally rejected. Checkpoint blockade therapy is used clinically to promote immune rejection of progressing tumors. We found that checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies restore glucose in the microenvironment of progressing tumors, permitting T cell glycolysis and IFN-γ production. Together our results show that metabolic competition in the tumor microenvironment dictates effector T cell function and that this influences cancer progression. Combining therapies that blunt tumor metabolism with those that promote glycolysis in T cells could provide new effective treatments for cancer.</p>

                <p>Chih-Hao earned his undergraduate degree in Agriculture Chemistry (a.k.a. Biochemical Science and Technology) from National Taiwan University, and later obtained a master’s degree in Microbiology in 2001. He had served in the army as a second lieutenant to fulfill a compulsory 2-year military service in Taiwan. Afterwards he worked in academic/industrial settings as a researcher and developed shrimp vaccines against shrimp white spot syndrome virus. During the time, he decided to have advanced education abroad and pursue a career in scientific research. He went to England studying for his doctoral work under the mentorship of Prof. Andrew McMichael at Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford. There his doctoral project focused on the impact of HIV subtype diversity and evolution in shaping host immune responses. He completed his doctoral degree in Clinical Medicine in 2010. He then joined in Dr. Erika Pearce’s laboratory in 2011. He is currently investigating metabolic regulation in T cells and how cellular metabolism regulates the generation, maintenance and functions of these cells.</p>

                <h3>Impaired Interstitial HDL Transit in Psoriasis: an Immunological Clue in Atherosclerosis</h3>
                <p>
                  <em>Li-Hao Huang, Ph.D.</em><br>
                  Post-doctoral Research Scholar in Gwendalyn Randolph Laboratory,

                </p>
                <p>High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is cardioprotective, but plasma HDL levels do not necessarily predict cardiovascular outcomes. The major HDL-associated protein apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) picks up its cholesterol from cells within extravascular compartments to return it to plasma and then bile. Yet, tools are lacking to quantify the important step of HDL transit through extravascular spaces. Here, we developed recombinant photoactivatable apoA-I to quantify endogenous HDL recirculation.  Using the tool, we studied HDL passage through skin in healthy mice versus those with experimental psoriasis, wherein collagen density increased in the skin in a CD4+ T cell-dependent manner. In control mice, photoactivated HDL mobilized to plasma within 2 h but was retained in collagen-enriched skin of mice with psoriasis. These data suggest that cardiovascular comorbidity in psoriasis might be linked to T cell-mediated structural changes in skin that impedes systemic recirculation of HDL. This new tool is likely to find wide application in HDL research.</p>

                <p>I graduated in Chemistry at National Taiwan University, where my passion for science started to be ignited. I studied the biochemical functions of a validated drug target for type II diabetes named DPP4. It was a very enlightening experience in the beginning of my scientific career. Based on the published crystal structure, which revealed active form of DPP4 existing as a dimer, we hypothesized that the monomeric form is inactive. I then tested the hypothesis and discovered that a conserved single mutation, located at the interface of two monomers, is required for DPP4 dimer stability and activity. The results implicated a potential therapeutic opportunity to inhibit DPP4 activity by targeting the interface. I really enjoyed the thought process that eventually would lead to answers. Inspired by this research experience, I decided to pursue my Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. My Ph.D. work was to study a puzzle that has existed for over a decade: global loss of ACAT1 enlarges atherosclerotic lesions, while ACAT inhibitors reduce those lesions in various animal models. I found that ACAT1 deficiency in stem/progenitor cells induces leukocytosis, potentially leading to atherosclerosis.  I generated a conditional myeloid-specific ACAT1 knockout mouse and showed that it is protected from obesity and atherosclerosis. The results strongly suggested that ACAT1 in macrophages could be a potential target for various metabolic diseases. My graduate school training reinforced my passion for science and led me to expand my interests in immunology. I am currently a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Gwendalyn Randolph’s lab in the Pathology and Immunology Department at Washington University in St. Louis. I am keenly interested in understanding how tissue-localized HDL egresses from tissues and recirculates back to the blood compartment through lymphatic vasculature, and how this process is regulated through immune cells.  This may answer a long unsolved question: why does a pharmacological increase in plasma HDL levels fails to provide clinical benefits?  Ultimately, I wish to pursue a career as a principal investigator focusing on how the crosstalk between lipoproteins and immune cells impacts metabolic and inflammatory diseases.</p>

                <h3>Identification of BET Bromodomain Inhibitors as Novel Antivirals of Human Cytomegalovirus</h3>
                <p>

                  Post-doctoral Research Associate in Deborah Lenschow Laboratory,

                <p>Human CMV is a widespread opportunistic pathogen and established lifelong infections in 50-80% of adults in United States. Even though human CMV infection is usually asymptomatic, it acts as an opportunistic pathogen and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, including transplant recipients and AIDS/HIV patients. Most importantly, CMV is the most frequent congenital infection and the leading viral cause of birth defects in newborns. Following congenital infection, CMV pneumonitis may be severe, even lethal. Annually approximately 40,000 U.S. infants are born with congenital CMV infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leaving 8,000 with permanent disabilities such as hearing and vision loss, or mental retardation. However, current CMV therapeutics are problematic. A limited number of drugs are licensed for the treatment of CMV infection and no vaccine is available. Standard therapy for CMV relies on oral/intravenous Ganciclovir (GCV) or its oral prodrug, Valganciclovir. Although efficacious, GCV treatment suffers from dose-related toxicities. Forscarnet (FOS) and Cidofovir (CDV), the two commonly used second-line treatments for CMV, are also associated with significant toxicities, including renal toxicity. Due to drug toxicities, standard therapies for CMV are restricted from neonatal usage. Moreover, during prolonged/repeated application, CMV can become resistant to GCV and lead to treatment failure. In recent years, GCV resistance in CMV infections has increased and cross-resistance to either or both second-line agents (FOS &amp; CDV) is frequently encountered because all licensed drugs share a common target molecule, the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. Therefore, the development of new anti-CMV therapeutics focusing on a novel mechanism of action (MOA) beyond DNA polymerase inhibitors is of critical important.</p>
                <p>To address the unmet need of CMV therapeutics, we explored the molecular mechanisms of CMV transcription to explore potential antiviral targets. Since CMV utilizes the host transcriptional machinery to transcribe its own transcripts, we adopted the drug-repurposing approach to identify host factors essential to viral transcription. Targeting a host protein instead of a viral one reduces the chance of a drug-resistant virus emerging. Through this approach, we identified BET bromodomain proteins, human epigenetic readers, as a potential novel target.  BET bromodomain proteins, including Brd2, Brd3, Brd4, and BrdT, binds to acetylated lysines on histones to regulate gene transcription. Small molecule inhibitors of BET bromodomain proteins (iBETs) are the next-generation of epigenetic-based therapeutics being developed by pharmaceutical companies for cancers, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, and male contraception. Preclinical research and preliminary results of clinical trials have shown that iBETs possess good bioavailability, low toxicity, and long-term usage capacities. However, the anti-viral potentials of iBETs against CMV infection have never been tested.</p>
                <p>Using an <i>in vitro</i> cell culture system, we found that iBETs effectively inhibit viral infections of both human CMV and murine CMV, the mouse homolog of human CMV, at concentrations that have no known toxicities.  Further characterization further revealed that iBETs could elicit anti-viral activities <i>in vivo</i>. Our preliminary studies identifying iBETs as an exciting new class of potential anti-CMV therapies.</p>

                <p>Macrophages are important effector cells that play pivotal roles in a broad range of immunologic and homeostatic processes in different tissues. The ability of these cells to serve multiple functions reflects their ability to express different genes in response to distinct extracellular signals including pathogenic insults and cytokines. Alternatively activated (M2) macrophages are induced by Th2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and/or IL-13, and which are important in immunity to helminth infections, tissue remodeling, wound repair and also tumorigenesis. Recent work has revealed that macrophage activation is linked to changes of metabolic status. My research interests focus on understanding how metabolic pathways (intrinsically and/or extrinsically) control M2 macrophage innate immunity, and what the reciprocal interactions between M2 macrophages and diseases are.</p>

                <p>Local tissue damage must be limited by host factors. Without such factors, minor damage to the inner lining of the intestine can’t activate proper responses against the damage. Our hypothesis is that locally induced factors protect the tissue through macrophage activation. We performed an expression screen at the colonic wound site and found that mesothelin (Msln), a GPI-linked molecule linked to cancer metastasis, was highly induced. In situ hybridization showed its expression is limited to epithelial and mesothelial cells near the wound site. Mucosal injuries to <i>Msln<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice have less macrophages in the muscularis propria by day 6 post injury. Through cytokine screening, we identified downregulation in interleukin (IL)-33 in <i>Msln<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice’s wounds. <i>Il33<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice phenocopied <i>Msln<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice in terms of macrophage in the muscularis propria. In vitro culture also showed that <i>Il33<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Msln<sup>-/-</sup></i> mesothelial cells both had delayed transdifferentiation and proliferated less. The two other models, including intestinal cancer and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, showed the same defect in macrophage recruitment. Overall, these findings show a novel mechanism of tissue repair by Msln, and suggest that Msln modulates the tissue repair in a macrophage and IL-33-dependent manner.</p>

                <p>B cell (B lymphocyte) plays an important role in the adaptive as well as innate immunity by secreting antibodies, presenting antigens to T cells, and releasing cytokines.  In rodents and humans, B cells originated from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.  There, the developing B cells undergo immunoglobulin (Ig) gene loci arrangements and positive/negative selections. IgM<sup>+</sup> immature B cells exit the bone marrow and migrate to the spleen passing through two transitional stages, T1 and T2.  Some T2 B cells later differentiate into mature IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> follicular B (FO B) cells, or marginal zone B (MZB) cells in the spleen.</p>
                <p>We accidentally found that the CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-GFP knock-in transgenic mice in our mouse colony lacked most of the B cell populations in multiple tissues, including blood, spleen, inguinal lymph node, bone marrow and peritoneal cavity, although regular CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-GFP knock-in transgenic mice have normal lymphocyte populations.  Not surprisingly, the serum immunoglobulin (antibodies) levels in these affected transgenic mice were significantly reduced.  The remaining tissue B cells were all IgD<sup>-</sup>, indicating their immature statuses.  Characterization of developing B cell subsets by flow cytometry revealed that B cell development was arrested at T1 stage in the spleen.  In mixed bone marrow chimeric settings, CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-GFP bone marrow showed a severe cell-intrinsic disadvantage to give rise to mature B cells.  By crossing affected CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-GFP mice with wild-type mice, we found that the B cell phenotype was autosomal recessive and unrelated with CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-GFP allele.  We hypothesized that these mice in our animal facility might have acquired spontaneous mutation(s) that was indispensable for B cell development.  We would use whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify exosomal variants that might be responsible for the severe B cell phenotype.</p>

                <p>Germinal center B cells are selected to enter either the memory B cell or the long-lived plasma cell compartment, yet the underlying mechanisms that control this decision are unknown.  Our recent work utilizing a West Nile Virus (WNV) infection system demonstrated that the antigen specificity between the memory B cell and long-lived plasma cell compartments differed.  Long-lived plasma cells primarily recognized the dominantly neutralizing epitope, the lateral ridge, of West Nile Virus envelope protein domain III (DIII). In contrast, memory B cells could recognize the lateral ridge epitope and non-lateral ridge epitopes.  We hypothesized that non-lateral ridge-specific B cell receptors fail to reach an affinity threshold that promotes the long-lived plasma cell fate. To assess this, we utilized DIII-tetramers that are or are not mutated at the lateral ridge to identify antigen-specific memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. V(D)J sequences from these cells were cloned into expression vectors for antibody production.  The binding patterns of these monoclonal antibodies, at the affinity matured and germline-reverted states, were assessed by ELISA and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). Preliminary data indicates that non-lateral ridge-specific antibodies bind DIII more poorly than lateral ridge-specific antibodies. This difference is more striking when germline forms of these antibodies are compared. Non-lateral ridge-specific antibodies are present during early germinal center reactions when memory B cells are formed, but are progressively lost at later timepoints when long-lived plasma cells emerge. Our preliminary data suggest the existence of an antibody affinity threshold that promotes germinal center B cell retention and long-lived plasma cell selection.</p>
